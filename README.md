## Project Highlights
During this development journey, I was responsible for crafting an innovative messaging platform that seamlessly integrates RESTful APIs with powerful technologies like Django REST Framework (DRF), React, and Material-UI, resulting in an immersive and efficient messaging experience.

**Key Achievements:**

- **Robust Chat Server Administration API**: I designed and developed a robust chat server administration API, equipped with advanced features such as server filtering, channel management, related data retrieval, secure authentication, WebSocket support, and seamless integration with external APIs through uvicorn FastAPI.

- **Optimized Database Design**: I implemented an optimized SQL relational database design, harnessing Django's ORM capabilities to ensure data integrity, security, scalability, and high-performance data storage solutions.

## Technology Stack
- [Frontend](https://github.com/ekbostan/ChatConnect360/tree/main/React_frontend): React and Material-UI
- [Backend](https://github.com/ekbostan/ChatConnect360/tree/main/Chat_app): Django REST Framework and uvicorn FastAPI
- Database: SQL (Optimized with Django ORM)
- WebSocket Support
